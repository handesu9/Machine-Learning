Title: Machine Learning Techniques for Customer Churn Prediction

Goal:
A customer churn dataset is acquired. On this dataset, various machine learning models are created.
Best ML model is selected and importance of each feature is determined through the selected model.
Companies can determine which aspects to focus on to be able to make their customers stay.

Prerequisites:
-The notebook is in the form of .ipynb file. Therefore, in order to use the source code file, jupyter notebook is needed.
-To be able to read the data, file directory present in the second code block should be changed.
-Necessary packages (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) must be installed.
